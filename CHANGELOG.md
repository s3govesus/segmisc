## CHANGELOG

### 0.4.1: queue
- added a `Queue` class for implementing queue structures

### 0.3.1: separateIP
- added `separateIP()` - a function for receiving a combined string of both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses and separating them out into either one or the other, or an object containing both

### 0.2.1: cipher
- added a cipher for alphanumeric values

### 0.1.2: sleep
- added `sleep()` which can be used to put a pause in an otherwise asynchronous function - I've mostly used this to avoid bombarding databases with too many connection requests when setting up certain programs that are multi-threaded

### 0.1.1: initial commit
- initial commit
